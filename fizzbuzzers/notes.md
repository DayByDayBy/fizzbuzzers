<h1>ideas for other folders/exercises</h1>

reverse a string
anagram solver
geometry solver (args: 'shapeType string, dimensionA n, dimensionB n' maybe?)
fibonacci finder (given n, is f?/give digit n of f, etc)
sort algorithms, maybe? quicksort or bubble, or merge?

maybe have a skim of euler, pick a few from there?

have added sorting as a folder, willl work trhough a few of those, may also take one or more of the AoC problems and refactor once i ruin out of more basic problems to work through 

have also focussed on javascript and python a bit more lately, but plan to get back to widening the pool once i have a few sorting examples in the bag

thinkinng idle thoughts about hosting too; altho that's less or a priority atm, it would be kinda nice especially if i can properly wrangle multilingual support, have more than just a page of various javascript
